Grademaster v0.4, release 2020-07-05

A basic Python program to accept an input database of grades over a semester and do any of the following operations:

1. Compute a rough outline of future grade predictions
2. Enable the lecturer to auto generate feedback emails to students based on performance.
3. Generate a class report and store to various files for reference.

Of course, this code is still open to modifications. A few items I didn't get to explore were:

1. Use better regression techniques to predict scores.
2. Generate per person statistics (Although the message file does a decent job at this).
